# Orbitrix

## Description
**Orbitrix** is a particle-based simulation project that creates **galaxy-like dynamics** and visually stunning particle effects. It simulates thousands of particles representing stars, dust, or celestial bodies, and models their motion under gravitational forces to form spiral, elliptical, or custom galaxy patterns.

## Key Features
- Real-time particle simulation with dynamic motion.
- Visualizes galaxy structures like spiral arms, cores, and clusters.
- Customizable parameters: particle count, speed, gravity strength, and colors.
- Interactive features: users can attract, repel, or manipulate particles.
- Optional support for multiple galaxies, collisions, or mergers.

## Use Cases
- Educational tool for learning particle systems, gravity simulation, and astrophysics concepts.
- Interactive visual art or screensaver showcasing galaxy patterns.
- Demonstration of graphics programming techniques using WebGL, Three.js, or shaders.

## Technologies / Languages
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS (web-based)
- WebGL / Three.js for 3D visualization
- Optional: Unity / C# for executable simulations, or Python for backend computations
